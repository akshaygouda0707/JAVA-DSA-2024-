# 60-Day Java and DSA Learning Plan

Welcome to the 60-Day Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning plan! This plan is designed to help you strengthen your Java programming skills and master fundamental concepts of Data Structures & Algorithms within 60 days.

## Overview

This learning plan focuses on mastering Java programming and key concepts of Data Structures & Algorithms.

## Plan

1. **Java Basics**: Learn variables, data types, operators, control flow, loops, decision-making, functions, and methods.
2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Understand inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, and file I/O.
3. **Collections Framework**: Explore arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, and heaps.
4. **Algorithms**: Study searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.

## Resources
